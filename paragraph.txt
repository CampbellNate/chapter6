The way that you can use the replace operator is to replace certain characters inside a string with another. The way you would do this would be to first pick the string, then in the parentheses you first put the character that you are looking to replace. Then you put the character(s) that you want to replace the character with. Finally you can also put the number of times you want to replace a character, for example if you had a string 'payp' and used replace with p then a for one it would return aayp. this could be used to replace words in a text document.
